The MOD Duo is sponsored by [MOD Devices](https://www.moddevices.com), a Berlin-based company
and creator of the MOD technology.

The unit they give away as a prize is a *Developer Unit*, which has the same features as the
MOD Duo you can get in stores, but with an enclosure from the original 2016 Kickstarter campaign.

The unit will be shipped to the winner for free within Europe.


# Second and Third Prize

Unfortunately, we don't offer any prizes for the second and third places yet, though they will be
announced at the [Sonoj Convention](https://sonoj.org) too and their fame and glory spread over the
internets.
