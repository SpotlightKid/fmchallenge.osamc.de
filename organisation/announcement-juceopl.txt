Subject: FYI: JuceOPLVSTi selected for the Open Source Music FM Synthesizer Challenge

Hi there,

I hope it's ok to post this here, since I couldn't find any other contact info anywhere. Feel free to close this issue after reading.

I just wanted to let you know that JuceOPLVSTi is one of the FM software synthesizers we selected to be used for the Open Source Music FM Synthesizer Challenge, which we are organizing in September/October 2018:

Feel free to link to the competition on your homepage or tweet about it (you can mention @osamCologne) and if you would like to take part in the competition that would be very welcome indeed! :)

Best wishes and thanks for the great synth!
