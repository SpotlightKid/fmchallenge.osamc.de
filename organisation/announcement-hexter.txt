Subject: Hexter selected for the Open Source Music FM Synthesizer Challenge

Hi Sean,

I just wanted to let you know that Hexter is one of the FM software
synthesizers we selected to be used for the Open Source Music FM
Synthesizer Challenge, which we are organizing in September/October:

Feel free to link to the competition on your / the hexter homepage and
if you would like to take part in the competition that would be even
better! :)


Best wishes and thanks for the great synth!
