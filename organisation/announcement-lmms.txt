Subject: LMMS selected for the Open Source Music FM Synthesizer Challenge


Hello LMMS-Project,

I just wanted to let you know that OpulenZ is one of the FM software synthesizers we selected to be used for the Open Source Music FM Synthesizer Challenge, which we are organizing in September/October:

Feel free to link to the competition on your forum or somewhere on the LMMS homepage and if you would like to take part in the competition that would be even
better! :)

If you want, I can also send you the full announcement text (similar to what's on the landing page of the URL above).

Best wishes and thanks for the great Open Source project!
